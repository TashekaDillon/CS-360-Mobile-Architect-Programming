# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goals and requirements of the application were to help users keep track of their weight goals by having an apllication that stored their weight data so that they could keep track of their goal whether that meant that they were gaining or losing.
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The design of the application would have mostly centered around the user's profile and them having a clear a indicator of what their weight is and overall trend of their progress.
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I mostly started with the base of the project which was the UI component of the screens for the application and attempted to build from there.
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I did run into a lot of errors that halted the overall functionality of the application which stunted my progress.
# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The errors that I ran into were a lot more diffcult to overcome than I anticipated, so overcoming them became a challenge.
# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was able to be successful in mapping out the UI design of the application and struggled moreso with the functionality of the application overall.
